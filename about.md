## About

People always ask if I'm from Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City when I tell them I'm from Vietnam. But neither of those big cities in which I grew up.

I'm from [Lao Cai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lào_Cai_province){:target="_blank"}, a province squeezed right next to the Vietnam-China border. It is the homeland of 25 out of 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam, and there located [Fansipan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansipan){:target="_blank"} - the highest mountain in the Indochina.

Fun fact: I could literally walk to China in 20 minutes from our house.

## Foodie

I love food. One of the best part of my experience living in the U.S. is being able to expose many cuisines from all over the world.

My love language is food. I cook and enjoy sharing Viet taste to my loved ones. But I’m never patient enough to write down my recipes...
