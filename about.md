## About

I grew up in [Lao Cai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lào_Cai_province){:target="_blank"}, a small town right on the Vietnam-China border. It takes just 20 minutes to walk from my house to China, and on Lunar New Year's Eve, I could watch fireworks from both countries.

My Vietnam isn't the bustling streets of Ho Chi Minh City or the historic buildings of Hanoi. It's the mountains, the rice terraces, and the blend of cultures from many ethnic groups.

## Misc

I LOVE FOOD!!! I like eating, cooking, and learning about food from different countries. But sorry, I'm biased — Vietnamese food is THE best.

I recently started running (more seriously) with my partner, and we love it! When we visited my hometown in the summer of 2025, we ran along the Red River — the natural border between Vietnam and China. I’ve always known how close we live to the border, but that run still amazed me with just how near it really is.
