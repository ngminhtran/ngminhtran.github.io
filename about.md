## About

People always ask if I'm from Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City when I tell them I'm from Vietnam. But I'm a mountain girl, growing up in [Lao Cai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LÃ o_Cai_province){:target="_blank"}, a small town squeezed right next to the Vietnam-China border. It literally takes me 20 minutes to walk to China from my house. On Lunar New Year's Eve, I could watch both Vietnam's and China's fireworks - just an hour apart ðŸ˜Ž

You may have heard of [Sa Pa](https://youtu.be/BnbL8ZDl0do?si=FlTUsz0ZN8HerBQa){:target="_blank"} with stunning rice terraces, but my hometown offers more than just that!!! Come visit some smaller / less touristy places like [Nghia Do](https://youtu.be/jgF6m7zwdnw?si=sTkQ11YLNun3Pomn){:target="_blank"} (Bao Yen), [Y Ty](https://youtu.be/7vaojMfzbw4?si=Y9f2w8MEPR9hMDUE){:target="_blank"} (Bat Xat), or [Bac Ha](https://youtu.be/1o2aVH0RHGk?si=pauMJH-Yr5gv5_Ev){:target="_blank"}. Believe me, your mind will be blown by the natural beauty, and you will truly be able to blend in a melting pot of cultures!!!

## Foodie

I love food. One of the best part of my experience living in the U.S. is being able to expose to many different cuisines.

My love language is food. I cook and enjoy sharing Viet taste to my loved ones. But Iâ€™m never patient enough to write down my recipes...
