## Research

*"I'm afraid I know nothing about computer science..."*


Iâ€™m fascinated by how kids feel when they first expose to CS in a formal setting, especially those who have no or very little personal connection to it.
My research spans CS education in K-8 (ages 8-14).
Through design-based research, my current work focuses on developing both psychological and practical interventions for creating localized CS learning materials that faciliate student learning while optimizing teacher workload.
