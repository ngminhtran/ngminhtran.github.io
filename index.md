## Research

*My goal as a researcher is to make mainstream CS classrooms more personally meaningful, especially for kids with limited personal connection to computing and technology.*

My research is in Computer Science Education, focusing on personalizing and sustaining K-8 CS curriculum. I study the decision-making and challenges of CS teachers and develop approaches and tools to help them create customized curricular materials that fit their local contexts. I am currently exploring both static supports (scaffolding and professional development) and dynamic supports (generative AI as thought-partners and productivity tools for teachers).
