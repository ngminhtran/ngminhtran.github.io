## Research

My research spans culturally relevant and responsive computing education in K-8 (ages 8-14).
Iâ€™m fascinated by how kids feel in CS classrooms, especially those who are not well served by mainstream instruction.
I use design-based research and qualitative analysis to identify and address challenges faced by students and teachers, and develop interventions to make CS classrooms a meaningful and engaging space for kids while ensuring their learning outcomes and optimizing the workload for teachers.
