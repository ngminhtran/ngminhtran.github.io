## Research

My research is in Computer Science Education, focusing on designing and implementing personalized learning experiences that enhance student engagement and learning while maintaining a manageable workload for teachers (teaching students ages 9-13).

I am currently exploring the following directions:

**Teacher-Led Curriculum Customization:** What knowledge, supports, and scaffolds are needed to empower teachers to adapt CS instructional materials to their students' cultures and experiences?

**Teacher-AI Co-Creation:** How can we leverage AI to help teachers prepare CS instructional materials while retaining teacher agency?

**Classroom Impact:**
* How do teaching practices shift when CS teachers are teaching materials they have created without and with AI support?
* How do students respond to materials created by their teachers?
* How do teacher-authored lesson materials impact students from historically excluded populations in computing?

*My goal as a researcher is to make CS more accessible, especially for kids with limited personal connection to computing and technology or those who have a non-dominant cultural background.*
