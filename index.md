## Research


I’m fascinated by how kids feel when they first expose to computer science in a formal setting, especially those who have no or very little personal connection to it.
My research spans culturally responsive Computer Science Education (CSEd) at the K-8 level (ages 8-14).

Through design-based research, my current work focuses on developing scaffolds and tool supports for creating localized computer science instructional materials that faciliate student engagement and learning while optimizing teacher workload.
